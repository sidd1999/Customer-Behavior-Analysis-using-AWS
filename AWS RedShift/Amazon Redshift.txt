1) Redshift Cluster Setup:
Created an Amazon Redshift cluster with appropriate configurations for data analysis.
Ensured the cluster had an IAM role with AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to allow data import from S3.

2)Table Creation:
Defined a table in Redshift (clickstream_data) to match the structure of the JSON data you generated. The table included columns for timestamp, user_id, session_id, page_url, action_type, and product_id.

3)Data Import:
Used the COPY command to load the JSON data from an S3 bucket into the Redshift table.
Verified that the data was imported correctly by running a basic SELECT query.

4)Data Analysis with SQL Queries:
Ran various SQL queries to analyze the data:
Total Actions Count: Determined the total number of user actions recorded in the dataset.
Hourly Activity Analysis: Aggregated user actions by hour to observe trends in user engagement over time.
Product View Analysis: Identified the most viewed products to understand product popularity.
Conversion Rate Calculation: Calculated conversion rates for products by comparing views to purchases.
User Journey Analysis: Analyzed user navigation paths on the website to understand common journeys.

5)Deriving Business Insights:
Based on the query results, derived insights related to user behavior, product performance, and conversion rates.
Provided recommendations for optimizing product marketing, user experience, and overall platform performance.
