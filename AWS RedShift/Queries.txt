1) SELECT * FROM clickstream_data LIMIT 10;

2) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clickstream_data;

3) Analyze User Activity Over Time
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
    COUNT(*) AS actions
FROM 
    clickstream_data
GROUP BY 
    hour
ORDER BY 
    hour;

4) Identify the Most Viewed Products
SELECT 
    product_id, 
    COUNT(*) AS views
FROM 
    clickstream_data
WHERE 
    action_type = 'view'
GROUP BY 
    product_id
ORDER BY 
    views DESC
LIMIT 10;

5) Calculate Conversion Rates for Products
SELECT 
    product_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN action_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 END) AS purchases,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN action_type = 'view' THEN 1 END) AS views,
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN action_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN action_type = 'view' THEN 1 END), 0)) AS conversion_rate
FROM 
    clickstream_data
GROUP BY 
    product_id
ORDER BY 
    conversion_rate DESC;


6) Analyze User Journeys
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    session_id, 
    LISTAGG(page_url, ' -> ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS journey
FROM 
    clickstream_data
GROUP BY 
    user_id, session_id
ORDER BY 
    user_id, session_id;
