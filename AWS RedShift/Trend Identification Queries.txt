1. User Activity Trends
You can track the number of user actions over time to see when your platform is most active

SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour,  -- You can change 'hour' to 'day', 'week', etc.
    COUNT(*) AS actions
FROM 
    clickstream_data
GROUP BY 
    hour
ORDER BY 
    hour;

-----------------------------------------
2. Product Popularity Trends
Analyze how views or purchases of specific products change over time.

SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS day, 
    product_id, 
    COUNT(*) AS views
FROM 
    clickstream_data
WHERE 
    action_type = 'view'
GROUP BY 
    day, product_id
ORDER BY 
    day, views DESC;

-----------------------------------------
3. Conversion Rate Trends
Track how conversion rates (the percentage of users who view a product and then purchase it) change over time.

WITH views AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS day,
        product_id,
        COUNT(*) AS view_count
    FROM 
        clickstream_data
    WHERE 
        action_type = 'view'
    GROUP BY 
        day, product_id
),
purchases AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS day,
        product_id,
        COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
    FROM 
        clickstream_data
    WHERE 
        action_type = 'purchase'
    GROUP BY 
        day, product_id
)
SELECT 
    v.day,
    v.product_id,
    v.view_count,
    p.purchase_count,
    (p.purchase_count * 100.0 / NULLIF(v.view_count, 0)) AS conversion_rate
FROM 
    views v
LEFT JOIN 
    purchases p
ON 
    v.day = p.day AND v.product_id = p.product_id
ORDER BY 
    v.day, v.product_id;


4. Sales Trends
Track how sales figures change over time.

SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', timestamp) AS day, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM 
    clickstream_data
WHERE 
    action_type = 'purchase'
GROUP BY 
    day
ORDER BY 
    day;
