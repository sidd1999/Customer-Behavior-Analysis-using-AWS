AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service provided by Amazon Web Services. It helps prepare and transform your data for analytics.

Step 1: Access AWS Glue Console

Step 2: Set Up the Data Catalog 
Before performing ETL, ensure your processed data is cataloged in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. 
If you haven’t set up a Glue Crawler to catalog the data, follow these steps:
Create a Crawler:
Go to the Crawlers section in AWS Glue.
Click Add crawler and follow the prompts to create a crawler that points to your processed/ folder in S3 
Run the Crawler:
Run the crawler to catalog the data, creating tables in the Glue Data Catalog.
Once your data is cataloged, you can proceed with the ETL process.

Step 3: Create an AWS Glue Job for ETL
An AWS Glue Job is where you define the ETL logic to transform your data. 
Go to the Jobs Section:
In the AWS Glue console, click on Jobs in the left-hand menu.
Click Create job to start creating a new ETL job. Select script spark
Set Transformations:
In the Glue job script editor, you can define transformations on your data.
Data Cleansing: 
Data Aggregation: 
Data Format Conversion: 
Save your script and the job configuration.
Run the Job:
After saving, you can run the job manually by selecting the job from the Jobs list and clicking Run job.
Monitor the job’s progress in the Glue console. You can check the logs to see detailed execution information.

Step 4: Validate and Analyze the Transformed Data
Check the Output:
After the job completes, navigate to the S3 location or database where the transformed data was written.
Verify that the data is correctly transformed and stored as expected.


If your data processing needs to run on a regular basis, you can schedule the Glue job to run automatically.
In the Glue job configuration, set up a schedule using a cron expression or select a predefined interval (e.g., daily, hourly).
Monitor Job Execution:
Use AWS CloudWatch or Glue’s built-in monitoring tools to track job performance and troubleshoot any issues.
