Inventory Management:
Given the high conversion rates of certain products, ensure these items are well-stocked to meet demand and avoid potential lost sales due to stockouts.
User Experience Enhancements:
Analyze and optimize user journey paths that lead to successful conversions. This might include A/B testing different page layouts, improving site navigation, or offering personalized recommendations based on previous user behavior.
